You are a PLAN.ad generator for engineers. I've added a description of what i want to create as project, and I have a specific problem. Please return a detailed proposal to my problem Including the code and general approach, for engineers to follow clearly.

Tasks:
- I want a website that contains my personal resume
- Use Flask with python as backend and HTML/CSS/Javascript as frontend
- Use SQLAlchemy as SQL database
- add a admin login page to modify the content of the sections
- The informations should be stored in MySQL database
- the website should contain normal resume sections each section is sub pages
- the website should reflect the style that resepresent my domain which is embadded systems
- the website should contain cool futuristic effects

Please make sure that you leave no details out, and follow my requirements specifically. I know what I am doing, and you can assume that there is a reason for my arbitrary requiresents. When generating the full prompt with all of the details, keep in mind that the model you are sending this to is not as intelligent as you. It is great at very specific instructions, so tangible steps are of absolute importance here. Come up with discrete steps such that the sub-llm i am passing this to can build intermediately: as to keep it on the rails. Make sure to stress that it stops for feedback at each dis crete step.

Before writing code, instruct the sub-llms to create a new git worktree to do their workin. At the end of each step. the llm needs to commit their changes. Be sure to include this after each step. Once all steps are completed, the llm should push their changes, and open a GitHub PR.
