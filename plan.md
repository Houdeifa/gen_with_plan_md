# Project Proposal: Android Snake Game App with Kivy

## Description:
The project is to create a classic Snake game app using Kivy with Python. The app should have multiple skins that change the style of the game, as well as menus and the ability to buy additional skins. Initially, the buy button will add a fixed amount of in-game currency, but future versions will require integration with a real payment API.

## Proposal:

### Step 1: Set up Project Environment
- Create a new git worktree for the project.
- Initialize a Kivy project structure with necessary files.
- Commit changes.

### Step 2: Implement Snake Game Logic
- Create the Snake game functionality, including movement, collision detection, and food generation.
- Test the basic functionality of the Snake game.
- Commit changes.

### Step 3: Design Menus and Skin Selection
- Implement menus for starting the game, selecting skins, and buying skins.
- Add functionality to switch between different skins.
- Test the menu and skin selection functionality.
- Commit changes.

### Step 4: Implement In-Game Currency System
- Create a basic in-game currency system that increments when the buy button is clicked.
- Test the in-game currency system.
- Commit changes.

### Step 5: Integrate Real Payment API
- Research and choose a real payment API to integrate into the app.
- Implement the API integration for purchasing skins with real currency.
- Test the payment process.
- Commit changes.

### Step 6: Final Testing and Refinement
- Conduct thorough testing of the entire app to ensure functionality and user experience.
- Refine any UI/UX elements as necessary.
- Commit changes.

### Step 7: Code Cleanup and Documentation
- Ensure code is well-documented with comments and docstrings.
- Clean up any redundant or unnecessary code.
- Finalize documentation for the project.
- Commit changes.

### Step 8: Push Changes and Create GitHub PR
- Push the final changes to the remote repository.
- Create a GitHub Pull Request for review and feedback.

## Conclusion:
This detailed plan outlines the steps needed to create the Android Snake Game app with Kivy. Each step includes specific tasks and commits to ensure progress and feedback at every stage of development. Following this plan will help in the successful completion of the project.
